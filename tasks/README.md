and if something wrong with the task and config you will be appreciated to modify the file by pulling request.üòç

## tasks

### How to use task json

`export task`:

enter taskmanage page and press the task card you want export will enter task edit page, long press the save float button the json will be copied to your clipboard.

## config
this folder is to store the default config json. and the format is below.

```
{
  "AppClean": {
    "path": [
      "/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/pack/cache",
      "/storage/emluated/0//pack/files/cache",
      "/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/pack/log"
    ],
    "exclude": false
  },
  "ChaosFile": {
    "regex": ".*.(log|logs)",
    "exclude": false
  },
  "ApkClean": {
    "regex": ".*.*(apk|apkm)$",
    "exclude": false
  }
}
```

you can see different block, and it's for `AppClean` `ChaosFile` `ApkClean`.

the AppClean Path is specify the path that appclean should scan and the `pack` in the path will be replace to every app's packname.

the ChaosFile regex is specify the file that which match the regex the file be the chaos file.

the ApkClean regex is specify the file that which match the regex the file be the Apk file.

the `exclude` can not be removed.ü§î However,it's useless.
